After apologizing for our website for over a year, the time had come for a significant upgrade.  A small team of folks spent several hours choosing the right theme to base our refresh on.  ’We’ decided on a theme from [FrogsThemes](http://www.frogsthemes.com/) and thus began my first experience with the young company.\n\nFull disclosure, when it comes to WordPress themes, I bleed Woo. [Woothemes](http://www.woothemes.com/) has been my go-to resource for quality, premium themes for several years.  So, as I write this review, that is my litmus test.\n\n###Visuals\n\nOverall, the design of FrogsThemes is very good. They are as polished, if not more polished, as the leaders in this space.  Their themes are not as generic (in a good way) as other theme producers, but they have wisely chosen to create themes for several different prominent niches.  For all intents and purposes, there isn’t much I can say here that can’t be derived from the demo areas of FrogsThemes.com. So I’ll focus my attention on the other areas.\n\n###Construction\n\nWith regards to construction, I felt FrogsThemes was mediocre.  I don’t know when the Agency Pro them was originally launched, but it is still pretty buggy.  Definitely more buggy than I would expect from a premium theme. Most of the issues were pretty basic. The FT Social widget just didn’t work and sliders on the ‘Portfolio’ page where broken.  The theme also lacked the customization options (from the theme settings) that I’m accustomed to. Things such as the blog showing excerpts vs. full posts, coloring choices, etc.  I’m thankful we have developers on staff that were able to fix these items. Otherwise, I think we would have punted and gone with another theme.\n\nI also take issue with the FrogsThemes model. Much like [Elegant Themes](http://www.elegantthemes.com/), a subscription is required for ongoing theme updates. It’s not so much the subscription I take issue with, as much as how it plays out. In short, this business model doesn’t support automatic theme updates. As a result, you would wisely set up a parent theme/child theme arrangement, so you can make future updates without wrecking any customization you’ve made. It’s just a pain in the butt. I definitely prefer WooThemes model, which does support automatic updates. It’s just so much easier to manage.\n\nLastly, FrogsThemes uses a ‘[Visual Composer](http://www.frogsthemes.com/theme-features#tab-02)‘ for many elements of the homepage and some custom page layouts.  For the sake of comparison, WooThemes typically uses custom fields or custom post types for these items.  Where custom post types feels very natural within WordPress, the visual editor did not. The visual composer walks you through a wizard-esque process that resulted in shortcodes being added to the page.  The editor wasn’t very reliable, however, it did the job.  For the most part, it just created an extra hurdle for some of our customization, as backend code became a bit convoluted.\n\n###Support\n\nThe FrogsThemes support was just okay.  They have a support ticketing system built into the member-only section of FrogsThemes.com, however response times were ‘average’ at best.  Considering the bugs we experienced in the theme, good & timely support would have gone a long way towards redeeming these shortcomings.\n\nOverall, I suspect many of these issues are just by-products of growing pains and hopefully they will be resolved as the company matures. In the meantime, I think I’ll stick with WooThemes. ","html":"<p>As a project manager at a digital marketing firm, I just wrapped up an internal project of overhauling our website.

If you want 'what everyone else' has, do 'what everyone else' does. If you want 'better', do 'better'.\n2. Make sure your spouse knows you love them, each and every day.\n3. Don't let idiots ruin your day. There are alot of them out there and you shouldn't give them that control over your life.\n4. Take pride in your work, both professional and otherwise.\n5.

Neither a borrower nor a lender be;\nFor loan oft loses both itself and friend,\nAnd borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.\n(William Shakespeare)\n9. You should always leave a place in better condition than you found it.\n10. The more lovey-dovey a relationship appears to be on Facebook, the more they fight in real life.\n11. Done is better than perfect.\n12. A small but fundemental marriage money tip: fun money accounts for both parties.

Make time to dream.\n15. Make plans to achieve those dreams.\n16. We only regard those unions as real examples of love and real marriages in which a fixed and unalterable decision has been taken.

Wise people learn from the mistakes of others.\n23. In the short-term, giving to a genuinely worthy cause is just as exciting as buying something for yourself. In the long-term, it has a much greater lasting impact.\n24. The Christian faith is much more simple than Christians would lead you to believe.\n25. I've owned really nice cars and I've lived in really nice homes. Having a peaceful home-life and plenty of money in the bank wins out 100% of the time.\n26. You don't have to tell 'em everything you know.\n27. Children do what feels good. Adults devise a plan and follow it.\n28. Great opportunities to help others seldom come.

It's the 3rd major social network to do so, with Facebook & LinkedIn being the notable pacesetters. It's obvious that advertising plays the largest role in valuing these companies. And as a marketer, I wanted to share my thoughts on this upcoming IPO.\n\n1. I don't think social networks are meant to go public. To become successful social networks, everything you do flies in the face of Wall St. - lots of customers, huge capital investment for infastructure and no income. But those things are required for success. You do everything you can to appease your customers, the users, so your network will grow to a critical mass. However, once you go public, your priority changes. Your customers are no longer the users. Your customers are now your investors. And the things your investers require are very much inline with Wall St. and likely NOT the things your users want (or they would already be there). So you begin a slow and steady decline.\n2. Twitter's advertising advantage comes in it's lack of privacy. Where Facebook and Linked are designed to limit yourself to your sphere of friends. Twitter has always been more universally focused. There is a global conversation available to most users.\n3. Twitter's advertising disadvantage is its clients. There are 50+ well known Twitter clients which users view the Twitter enviroment through. Although Twitter has cracked down on Auth Tokens, the clients still exist and provide value to their users. In a 'show me a 14ft wall and I'll show you a 15ft ladder' way, I have not doubt many of these clients will offer (or attempt to offer) ad-free environments to their users. Twitter will be faced with this battle, while trying to avoid losing a significant chunk of users, one Twitter client at a time.\n4. It seems that Facebook had more avenues for advertising within its platform. Twitter has sponsored tweets and perhaps a geolocation play. But outside of those avenues, I think Twitter will begin to feel spammy much quicker than Facebook has.\n5. Oh yeah, Twitter ads are terrible. I've worked with them in the past and have never seen results. So despite # 1-4, there is still a huge hurdle in the advertising platform itself.\n\nIn short, if you think Facebook has gone downhill since going public, just wait until you see what happens to Twitter.

My wife came home early, only to discover our home had been broken into.  Ugh...\n\nWe've only lived in the home a few months, but early on, we installed a series of [Dropcam](https://www.dropcam.com) cameras around the house.  When I received the dreaded call, my wife awaiting the arrival of the police, I logged on to my Dropcam DVR and watched the footage of the break-in.  As I watched the cowardly redneck struggle to gain entry into our house, I could feel my heart beat in my hands. \n\nThe police arrived, cleared the home, and started their initial investigation.  I told them about the cameras and the footage I had.  I pulled out my laptop and showed it to them. You could feel a extra level of interest on their part.  Suddenly we had more than a puncher's chance of solving this crime.  After they left, I downloaded the relevant clips from the DVR and edited them together into one cohesive video to pass along to the investigator. \n\nSoon, calls from friends and family started to come in.  We started getting peppered with a reasonable question, 'Do you guys feel safe staying at home tonight?'.  The more we were asked, the more mad I became. \n\n\"This is our house.  I'll be damned if I'm going to feel unsafe in my own home. I refuse to give this idiot _that_ kind of control over our life.\"\n\nMy catalog of awkward life moments is fairly lengthy, so I'm pretty skilled at handling them.  Humor and sarcasm are my default coping mechanisms.  As such, I made a dumb [animated gif](http://i.bett.is/E0N8) of the crook running out the door and sent it to my co-workers.  [Bobby](https://brb3.org/) suggested [the perfect soundtrack](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-benny-hill-show/id456902345?i=456902397&uo=4&at=11l5EZ) for the gif, and suddenly we were on the verge of something great.  The next thing I knew, I had created this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keG5nO1buME) - maybe some of my best work. \n\nThe video garnered unbelievable traction. At first, friends and family shared it. But before long, it received hundreds of shares from complete strangers.  Then, this happened:\n> * [News Channel 9](http://www.newschannel9.com/news/top-stories/stories/caught-camhouse-burglary-9794.shtml)\n> * [WRCB - Channel 3](http://www.wrcbtv.com/story/25131476/caught-on-camera-local-thief-clearly-seen-in-home-burlgary)\n> * [/r/Videos](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/21yvva/my_coworker_watched_somebody_break_into_his_house/)\n> * [/r/RBI](http://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/21z5me/someone_broke_into_a_friends_house_luckily_he_had/)\n> * [/r/Chattanooga](http://www.reddit.com/r/Chattanooga/comments/21yuwr/crowdsourced_justice_chattanooga_residential/)\n> * [Nooga.com](http://nooga.com/166099/video-do-you-recognize-this-burglar/)\n> * [David Carroll's Chattanooga Radio and TV](http://www.chattanoogaradiotv.com/general/good-advice-dont-break-into-a-web-designers-house/)\n\nThis crazy circumstance has taught (and/or reaffirmed) a few very important lessons:\n\n1. We are incredibly blessed to have so many friends that care about us and our well-being. \n2. Chattanoogans want our city to be safer.  We want to prevent things like this, not just for Rob & Rachel, but for our own friends & family too. \n3. Everyone loves a dumb crook. \n4. We ought not take ourselves or our circumstances too seriously. \n5. We should all have an emergency fund and proper insurance. \n6. I've never dealt with an insurance company that handled a claim efficiently and with honor. \n7. We really take our health and safety for granted. \n8. Criminals wear jorts.\n\nAs I write this post, the perp is still at large.  However, the police have several fingerprints  that are being processed and we have a couple of tips from kind citizens who saw the footage.  There are roughly 175,000 people in Chattanooga and I suspect roughly 30%-50% have seen this footage.  I am very hopeful that justice will come.  \n\nSpecial thanks to:\n\n* Jimmy, Callie, Joli, Emily, & Rachel - for bringing us dinner, dessert, & lumber the night of the break-in. \n* The Chattanooga PD - so far, they have been nothing short of great to work with. \n* [Dropcam](https://www.dropcam.com/) - every officer who has seen our footage has been complimentary of its quality. You guys make a great product. Keep it up. \n* [EPB](https://www.epb.net/) - for the fiber optic network that makes our footage possible. We're lucky to live in [The Gig City](http://www.thegigcity.com/).\n\nAlso, special thanks to everyone for their kind words and their time spent sharing the video. It takes a village to catch a burglar. And when we catch this guy, we will have all you Chattanoogans to thank!","html":"<p>Monday afternoon, I got one of those calls you never want to get.

Ugh...</p>\n\n<p>We've only lived in the home a few months, but early on, we installed a series of <a href=\"https://www.dropcam.com\">Dropcam</a> cameras around the house.  When I received the dreaded call, my wife awaiting the arrival of the police, I logged on to my Dropcam DVR and watched the footage of the break-in.  As I watched the cowardly redneck struggle to gain entry into our house, I could feel my heart beat in my hands. </p>\n\n<p>The police arrived, cleared the home, and started their initial investigation.  I told them about the cameras and the footage I had.  I pulled out my laptop and showed it to them. You could feel a extra level of interest on their part.  Suddenly we had more than a puncher's chance of solving this crime.  After they left, I downloaded the relevant clips from the DVR and edited them together into one cohesive video to pass along to the investigator. </p>\n\n<p>Soon, calls from friends and family started to come in.  We started getting peppered with a reasonable question, 'Do you guys feel safe staying at home tonight?'.  The more we were asked, the more mad I became. </p>\n\n<p>\"This is our house.  I'll be damned if I'm going to feel unsafe in my own home. I refuse to give this idiot <em>that</em> kind of control over our life.\"</p>\n\n<p>My catalog of awkward life moments is fairly lengthy, so I'm pretty skilled at handling them.  Humor and sarcasm are my default coping mechanisms.  As such, I made a dumb <a href=\"http://i.bett.is/E0N8\">animated gif</a> of the crook running out the door and sent it to my co-workers.  <a href=\"https://brb3.org/\">Bobby</a> suggested <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-benny-hill-show/id456902345?i=456902397&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l5EZ\">the perfect soundtrack</a> for the gif, and suddenly we were on the verge of something great.  The next thing I knew, I had created this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keG5nO1buME\">YouTube video</a> - maybe some of my best work. </p>\n\n<p>The video garnered unbelievable traction. At first, friends and family shared it. But before long, it received hundreds of shares from complete strangers.  Then, this happened:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.newschannel9.com/news/top-stories/stories/caught-camhouse-burglary-9794.shtml\">News Channel 9</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.wrcbtv.com/story/25131476/caught-on-camera-local-thief-clearly-seen-in-home-burlgary\">WRCB - Channel 3</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/21yvva/my_coworker_watched_somebody_break_into_his_house/\">/r/Videos</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/21z5me/someone_broke_into_a_friends_house_luckily_he_had/\">/r/RBI</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/Chattanooga/comments/21yuwr/crowdsourced_justice_chattanooga_residential/\">/r/Chattanooga</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://nooga.com/166099/video-do-you-recognize-this-burglar/\">Nooga.com</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.chattanoogaradiotv.com/general/good-advice-dont-break-into-a-web-designers-house/\">David Carroll's Chattanooga Radio and TV</a></li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This crazy circumstance has taught (and/or reaffirmed) a few very important lessons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>We are incredibly blessed to have so many friends that care about us and our well-being.  </li>\n<li>Chattanoogans want our city to be safer.  We want to prevent things like this, not just for Rob &amp; Rachel, but for our own friends &amp; family too.  </li>\n<li>Everyone loves a dumb crook.  </li>\n<li>We ought not take ourselves or our circumstances too seriously.  </li>\n<li>We should all have an emergency fund and proper insurance.  </li>\n<li>I've never dealt with an insurance company that handled a claim efficiently and with honor.  </li>\n<li>We really take our health and safety for granted.  </li>\n<li>Criminals wear jorts.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As I write this post, the perp is still at large.  However, the police have several fingerprints  that are being processed and we have a couple of tips from kind citizens who saw the footage.  There are roughly 175,000 people in Chattanooga and I suspect roughly 30%-50% have seen this footage.  I am very hopeful that justice will come.  </p>\n\n<p>Special thanks to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Jimmy, Callie, Joli, Emily, &amp; Rachel - for bringing us dinner, dessert, &amp; lumber the night of the break-in. </li>\n<li>The Chattanooga PD - so far, they have been nothing short of great to work with. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dropcam.com/\">Dropcam</a> - every officer who has seen our footage has been complimentary of its quality. You guys make a great product. Keep it up. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.epb.net/\">EPB</a> - for the fiber optic network that makes our footage possible. We're lucky to live in <a href=\"http://www.thegigcity.com/\">The Gig City</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Also, special thanks to everyone for their kind words and their time spent sharing the video. It takes a village to catch a burglar.
